          <p>D.O. stands for "Denominación de Origen" or in English. "designation of origin"</p>

          <p>Until 1988 D.O. was the highest category of Spanish wine, and comparable to France’s AOC (Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée).
          All the D.O.s have their own regulatory bodies called Consejos Reguladores, that are responsible for creating and maintaining the definition of each DO.
          These rules include which grape varieties are permitted, the ageing, and the types of wine. The DOs are a specific region, county, locality,
          or particular place that has been administratively recognized to designate wines that meet the following conditions:</p>

          <ul>
          <li>Have been made in the region, region, locality or specific place, with grapes from it</li>
          <li>Enjoy high prestige in commercial traffic in response to its origin</li>
          <li>Whose quality and characteristics are fundamentally or exclusively due to the geographical environment that includes natural and human factors</li>
          <li>In addition to having passed at least five years since its recognition as a quality wine with geographical indication (IGP)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>In Spain there were 68 DOs in 2019.</p>

          <p>Whites often hold their shape and expression easily for two nights. Reds, on the other hand, are more likely to change in structure after a day. If it’s a young, tannic, and full-bodied wine, this can be a good thing — you might even like it better on day two or three. Dessert wines can easily stretch for a week or two.</p>

        <div class="accordion-body">
          <p>Tannins are mostly responsible for that bitter taste that leaves your mouth feeling dry after you take a sip of a super tannic wine like a Cabernet Sauvignon. They mostly come from the grape skins, seeds, stems, and oak, and get stronger the longer the skins are in contact with the juice as it ferments. The same thing is also found in tea, and it’s what makes your drink bitter if you let it steep for too long.</p>

          <p>These terms are thrown around in the wine industry like grapes at harvest time. Everywhere. Essentially this can be viewed in two ways: The first is location. New world wines refer to those created in Australia, New Zealand and both North and South America. Old world refers to Western Europe. But this also refers to wine style as well. New world wines are often thought of as being heavier in fruit, alcohol by volume and oak, where the old guard wines are thought of as being more restrained and balanced, with lower levels of alcohol, higher levels of acidity and more earthy tones.</p>

          <p>Vintage, with regards to wine, does not mean ‘old’. Vintage is merely referring to the year the grapes were harvested – all the grapes in a vintage wine were all or mostly grown  and harvested in the same year. On the other hand, a wine that is not vintage would be a blend of harvests from several different years.</p>
