Prompt user for height

Height prompt should have a condition that it has to be 1 to 8 inclusive

If height is less than one or greater than 8 then prompt the user again for a height using a do while loop

Create a for loop that will iterate from 0 to height to print a space, a hash and then a new line for each row depending on how high the pyramid is
